# CG_2020_Projects

This is my CoderGirl final project repository.  Part 1 is EDA for a heart disease dataset, and Part 2 is for modeling and conclusions.

While reviewing the data, the samples lean heavily toward male vs. female information, so I looked into possible explanations of sex differences in heart disease progression 
  along with historical tendancies to misdiagnose females. 
  
In an effort to show how I would tackle the insights from a data project to form meaningful next-steps, I included suggestions to help people prevent heart disease as well as
  suggestions for researchers who may set up new studies for heart disease.
